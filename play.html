        <h5>GRE.</h5>

        <p style="font-family: Courier">
             Well! Scapin, and how have we succeeded about my son's
mischance?</p>
<h5>SCA.</h5>
<p style="font-family:Courier">
 Your son is safe, Sir; but you now run the greatest danger
imaginable, and I sincerely wish you were safe in your house.</p>

<h5>GRE.</h5>
 <p style="font-family:Courier">
    How is that?</p>
    <h5>SCA.</h5>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">While I am speaking to you, there are people who are looking
        out for you everywhere.</p>
        <h5>GRE.</h5>
 <p style="font-family:Courier">
    For me?</p>
    <h5>SCA.</h5>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">Yes.</p>
    <h5>GRE.</h5>
 <p style="font-family:Courier"> But who?</p>
 <h5>SCA.</h5>
    <p style="font-family:Courier">The brother of that young girl whom Octave has married. He
        thinks that you are trying to break off that match, because you
        intend to give to your daughter the place she occupies in the heart
        of Octave; and he has resolved to wreak his vengeance upon you. All
        his friends, men of the sword like himself, are looking out for you,
        and are seeking you everywhere. I have met with scores here and
        there, soldiers of his company, who question every one they meet,
        and occupy in companies all the thoroughfares leading to your house,
        so that you cannot go home either to the right or the left without
        falling into their hands.</p>
        <h5>GRE.</h5>
 <p style="font-family:Courier"> What can I do, my dear Scapin?</p>
 <h5>SCA.</h5>
    <p style="font-family:Courier"> I am sure I don't know, Sir; it is an unpleasant business. I
        tremble for you from head to foot and.... Wait a moment.(SCAPIN _goes to see in the back of the stage if there is anybody
        coming_.)
    </p>
        <h5>GRE.</h5>
        <p style="font-family:Courier">(_trembling_). Well?</p>
        <h5>SCA.</h5>
        <p style="font-family:Courier">(_coming back_). No, no; 'tis nothing.</p>

        <h5>GRE.</h5>
        <p style="font-family:Courier"> Could you not find out some means of saving me?</p>
        <h5>SCA.</h5>
        <p style="font-family:Courier">
            I can indeed think of one, but I should run the risk of a sound
beating.</p>
