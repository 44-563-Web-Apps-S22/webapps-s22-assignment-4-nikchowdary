            Ah! Scapin, show yourself a devoted servant. Do not forsake me,

        <p class="speech">
    I will do what I can. I feel for you a tenderness which renders

    shoulders, and carry you like a bundle of something or other. I
    shall thus be able to take you through your enemies, and see you
    safe into your house. When there, we will barricade the door and
    send for help.</p>
